# ATMA-Driving-Simulator

(1) Driving data collected from the driving simulation. 

"Raw Data"-> participant xx -> "experiment 1" is the low traffic volume data, "experiment 2" is collected in high traffic volume. 

(2) Gaze data collected from Tobii eye tracking.

"Raw Data"-> participant xx -> "Eye_tracker_Data_Px_xxxx.xlsx". 

(3) Code of data processing can be found in "Data Process" folder.  

(4) The processed and combined data can be found in release. Name is "Driving_Simulation_Experiment_Data_All_0723.csv". 

(5) A demo of designed driving simulation. Download "Demo.zip" in release, click "HighwayI90.exe" to start the simulator.

This demo is only support keyboard. Some function keys are listed following:
w --> accelarator;
s --> brake;
a,d --> wheel;
q,e -->left/right indicator;
B --> change to backing mode;

More videos and details can be found in my website:

Contact me if you need the source code for the simulation.

(6) If you use the code or data or the simulation from this project. Please cite our paper. The draft paper can be found here: (soon)
