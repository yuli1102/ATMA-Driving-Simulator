# ATMA-Driving-Simulator
ATMA: autonomous truck-mounted attenuator
This driving simulator was designed and developed for the ATMA study. In this study, out team aim to discover how drivers passing through road maintenance areas perceive, understand, and react to the ATMA system.

This shows What are the passing drivers supposed to do:

This shows concerns with Drivers Around ATMA

## driving sc

(1) Driving data collected from the driving simulation. 

"Raw Data"-> participant xx -> "experiment 1" is the low traffic volume data, "experiment 2" is collected in high traffic volume. 

(2) Gaze data collected from Tobii eye tracking.

"Raw Data"-> participant xx -> "Eye_tracker_Data_Px_xxxx.xlsx". 

(3) Code of data processing can be found in "Data Process" folder.  

(4) The processed and combined data can be found in release. Name is "Driving_Simulation_Experiment_Data_All_0723.csv". 

(5) A demo of designed driving simulation. Download "Demo.zip" in release, click "HighwayI90.exe" to start the simulator.

This demo is only support keyboard. Some function keys are listed following:
w --> accelerator;
s --> brake;
a,d --> wheel;
q,e -->left/right indicator;
B --> change to backing mode;
